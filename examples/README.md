## Examples of how to use Zila

This directory contains a number of examples showcasing various capabilities of
the `zila` crate.

Most examples can be executed with:

```
cargo run --example $name
```

but, some example uses unstable features and can be executed with:
```
cargo +nightly run --example $name
```

A good starting point for the examples would be [`call_every_second`](call_every_second.rs)
and [`set_timeout`](set_timeout.rs).

If you've got an example you'd like to see here, please feel free to open an
issue. Otherwise if you've got an example you'd like to add, please feel free
to make a PR!
